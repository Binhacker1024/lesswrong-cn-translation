We devote to translate Lesswrong (Hereinafter referred to as LW) posts into Chinese to spread the rationale of Eliezer Yudkowsky and his friends.

## Introduction to LW

## Collaboration

We are working in collaboration with [ParaTranz | LW Chinese Translation Project](https://paratranz.cn/projects/8703) to translate and proofread. 

And, this repository is used to store LW source files and Chinese translations.

## This repo

### Table of Contents

- Rationality: From AI to Zombies (A2Z)

### MD formatting

1. This inline field formatter should be at the top of every MD file.

```
